The **767-400ER** is the largest and final evolution of Boeing's 767 family. Its introduction in 2000, however came at a time when airlines were beginning to look towards newer aircraft designs. Despite its capabilities, it remains the least common 767 variant in commercial service, and has since been succeeded by the 787 Dreamliner.

767 aircraft are still in production as of 2025, though only in the form of freighter and military variants.
