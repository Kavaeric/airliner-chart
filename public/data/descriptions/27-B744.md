The **747-400ER** is the pinnacle of the iconic 747 design, offering extended range capabilities through additional fuel tanks and structural reinforcements. As the last major variant of the original 747 family, it carried the "Queen of the Skies" legacy into the 21st century.

The 747-400ER's impressive range and capacity made it a favourite for ultra-long-haul routes, though its four-engine configuration became increasingly expensive to operate as fuel prices rose.
