Part of the neo (New Engine Option) generation of the A330 family, the **A330-800** is the shorter, longer-range variant of the A330neo family, designed to replace the A330-200 with improved efficiency and extended range capabilities.

The A330-800 is notable in how rare it is: its greater range means worse range and capacity than its far more practical -900 sibling. As of 2025, only 7 of this type are in revenue service.
