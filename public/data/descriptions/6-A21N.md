The **A321neo** takes the successful A321 concept and fits it with new, more efficient engines, creating what many consider the perfect narrow-body aircraft. The LR (Long Range) variant has created a new wave of extremely "long and skinny" 7+ hour flights between lesser-served destinations.

The neo programme has garnered Airbus a sizeable backlog, with the A321neo making up half of the 7,000 backlogged orders with the company.
