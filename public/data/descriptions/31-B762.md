The **767-200ER** was Boeing's first widebody twin-jet airliner. As the first aircraft certified for 180-minute ETOPS, it proved that twin-engine aircraft could safely operate long-haul routes over water; and its two-engine configuration would prove vastly more efficient than its three- or four-jet contemporaries.
