The **A318** "Baby Bus" is the smallest member of the A320 family. Despite its compact size, it maintains the same cross-section as its larger siblings, offering very similar passenger comfort in a regional jet package.

Its limited range and higher operating costs per seat, though, meant it struggled to compete with more efficient regional jets, leading to its early discontinuation in 2013. It has since been supplanted by the A220.
