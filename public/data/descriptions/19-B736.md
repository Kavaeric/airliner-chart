The **737-600** is the smallest member of the 737 Next Generation family. Its compact size and efficient engines made it ideal for regional operations and smaller markets. Despite its capabilities, the 737-600 struggled to compete with more modern regional jets and was discontinued relatively early in the NG family's production run.
