The **A350-900ULR** (Ultra Long Range) is a specialised variant of the A350-900 designed exceptionally long-haul flights between distant cities.

Extended fuel tanks and an increased maximum takeoff weight pushes this variant's flight time to over 20 hours in some cases, which have compelled airliners to launch some of the longest nonstop commercial flights in history.
