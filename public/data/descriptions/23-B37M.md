The **737 MAX 7** is the smallest variant of Boeing's MAX family, designed to replace the 737-700 in this new fourth generation of the popular airliner. Despite being announced in 2017, the MAX 7 has faced significant delays in certification, with the FAA yet to provide a timeline for its approval as of 2025.

The type's certification challenges have been compounded by the broader issues affecting the MAX programme, including the MCAS-related accidents and subsequent regulatory scrutiny. Its future remains uncertain as airlines increasingly favour larger narrow-body aircraft.
